*****to run the flutter app => f5 key in the dart file that u r programming at

Also firebase is added to project. (followed setup-steps from yt)
=> refer to firebase-flutter playlist saved in yt for more info on using firebase with flutter
but one more thing:
while creatinng the app for android in ur firebase project,
also include SHA-1 field altho it is optional => u can get it by navigating to the android folder and running "./gradlew signingReport"

=> then install firebase_auth package into this flutter project to work with authentication


Project structure/ folder structure will be similar to ecommerceFrontend => example: productScreens,authScreens folder
Also fonts directory is created to store fonts in it. Then update pubspec.yaml
and create a folder for images too. (here we named the folder "images")
then add images in that folder in assets section in pubspec.yaml

App Logic:
First we will ask the user to login, and then the shopping app opens

So, basically
at our "home" route as defined in home.dart,
It will first see If we r logged in,
 => if we are, then it shows the main shoppring screen
 => if not, then it will take us to the login screen

 => packages:
 ->flutter_spin_kit => for a better loading indicator
->email_validator => checks if value inputted in TextField is valid as an email
